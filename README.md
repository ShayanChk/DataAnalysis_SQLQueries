# DataAnalysis_SQLQueries
hese queries cover a range of scenarios, including extracting information from databases, joining tables, and creating views. The repository includes SQL files for 
specific tasks such as displaying employee data for those in France, listing payments made by Canadian customers, and showing USA customers who haven't made any payments. 
Additionally, you'll find a view named vwCustomerOrder that presents detailed order information for each customer, along with product details. Feel free to explore the queries
and views to gain insights into my SQL skills and data analysis capabilities.
